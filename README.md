## Built With

## Development

The site is hosted directly on GitHub Pages. Any push to the `main` branch will automatically update the live site.

To generate the PDF resume from the LaTeX source, you will need a TeX distribution (like MacTeX) installed. You can then run:

```bash
xelatex ChrisGoetz_CV.tex
```

This will produce the `ChrisGoetz_CV.pdf` file.
